                <h1>With season on line, Justin Thomas ditches counterbalanced putter after one week</h1>
                <p>Justin Thomas’ latest putter experiment lasted just two rounds.</p>

                <p>Thomas, who has switched putters on a few occasions in recent years, moved to a Scotty 
                    Cameron prototype Phantom X9 putter with a 38-inch counterbalanced shaft for last week’s 
                    3M Open. However, after missing the cut in Minnesota and needing a strong finish at this 
                    week’s Wyndham Championship to crack the 70-man FedExCup Playoffs, Thomas has gone back 
                    to one of his trusty flatsticks, a Scotty Cameron X5 Tour Circle T with a 34.5-inch shaft.</p>
                    
                <p>“I just went back to my old faithful,” Thomas said Thursday after shooting even-par 70 
                    at Sedgefield Country Club. “I putted with it on Saturday last week after I missed the 
                    cut for probably like an hour, maybe a little more, on the putting green, it felt great. 
                    I think if it was a little different situation or a little different part of the season, 
                    I'd probably keep messing with it, but with a week like this, I want to have the putter in 
                    my hands that I've made the most clutch and successful and good putts with and that's what 
                    that one is.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thomas arrived in Greensboro, North Carolina, needing a minimum finish of solo 18th at the 
                    Wyndham to extend his season (he requires a solo third or better without any help to qualify 
                    for next week’s playoff opener in Memphis). His down year has been a combination of a 
                    ball-striking dip (No. 25 in strokes gained: tee-to-green) and struggles on the greens 
                    (No. 158 in strokes gained: putting).
